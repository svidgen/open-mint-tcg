Open Mint TCG is being built as an open source, open minting trading card game. Card creation will occur through <i>some form</i> of cryptographic mining, and aims at:

1. Having open-source, programmatic rules.
1. Being mostly stable, limiting the need to "keep up."
1. Evolving through RFCs.
1. Letting anyone create cards.
1. Limiting card population and impose rarity with fun crypto math.
1. Creating an aftermarket without being dominated by it. *(Hopefully)*

Refer to the article on [jonwire.com](https://www.jonwire.com/articles/2025/09/01/open-mint-tcg-part-1.html) for a description of how this can *essentially* work.

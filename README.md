# Open Mint Trading Card Game (TCG)

Just getting started. For now, you can read the backstory and concept in my article at [jonwire.com](https://www.jonwire.com/articles/2025/09/01/open-mint-tcg-part-1.html).

As ideas develop, I'll circle back to add some structure and some kind of [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) process.

Until then, seed your ideas and start conversations as [issues](https://github.com/svidgen/open-mint-tcg/issues).

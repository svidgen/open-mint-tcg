## Summary

Briefly describe the motivation and goal of the RFC.

## Motivation

Why is this change needed? What problem does it solve?

## Detailed Design

Describe the proposed change in detail. Include examples, diagrams, or code samples as needed.

## Drawbacks

What are the downsides or trade-offs?

## Alternatives

What alternatives were considered? Why were they discarded?

## Implementation

1. How should the work ideally be decomposed?
1. Is there anything unusual we need to know to implement?
1. Do we need an implementation plan to account for older clients, cards, etc.?

## Conformance Tests

Describe the tests that will be required for this RFC to be considered "Live".

## Open Items

List any open questions or areas needing further detail and discussion in subsequent PRs. If this section is empty, it implies that the RFC is complete and is ready to be **Approved**. Hence, if this RFC is *not* complete, the reasons it is not complete must be listed here.

This communicates the living status of RFC, sets the bar for PR reviewers, and invites contributions. (I hope!)

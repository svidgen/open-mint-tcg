## Summary

Briefly describe the motivation and goal of the RFC.

## Motivation

Why is this change needed? What problem does it solve?

## Detailed Design

Describe the proposed change in detail. Include examples, diagrams, or code samples as needed.

## Drawbacks

What are the downsides or trade-offs?

## Alternatives

What alternatives were considered? Why were they discarded?

## Conformance Tests

Describe the tests that will be required for this RFC to be considered "Live".

## Implementation

Nailing this section down is not strictly required to move an RFC into an **Approved** state. However, enumerating the recommended breakdown of deliverables can help contributors invest their time wisely. If you're unable to create a better breakdown of work, use this one:

1. Update [the spec](./spec/) to align with the RFC.
2. Add functionality to [the library](packages/lib/)
3. Update [conformance tests](./packages/conformance-tests/)
4. Update the status to **Live** in the feature branch.

## Open Items

List any open questions or areas needing further detail and discussion in subsequent PRs. If this section is empty, it implies that the RFC is complete and is ready to be **Approved**. Hence, if this RFC is *not* complete, the reasons it is not complete must be listed here.

This communicates the living status of RFC, sets the bar for PR reviewers, and invites contributions. (I hope!)

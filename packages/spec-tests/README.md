# @open-mint-tcg/spec-tests

Tests for the Open Mint TCG RFCs and specification itself. These tests will be used to demonstrate that the specifications themselves operate as intended. E.g., one might show via Monte Carlo simulations that an intended rarity characteristics is demonstrably true.

- Run with `npm test`.
- Add new tests as RFCs are accepted and the spec evolves.

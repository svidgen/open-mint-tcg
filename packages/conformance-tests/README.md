# @open-mint-tcg/conformance-tests

This package contains conformance tests for the Open Mint TCG spec and RFCs.

- Run with `npm test`.
- Add new tests as RFCs are accepted and the spec evolves.

## Monte Carlo/Spec Assumption Tests

Include tests that validate assumptions made by the spec, such as statistical properties or invariants (e.g., rarity distributions, hash properties, etc.).

Add these in the `test/spec-assumptions.test.js` file.

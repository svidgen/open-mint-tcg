# @open-mint-tcg/lib

Open Mint TCG library containing all "business logic" required by CLIs, servers, etc. to pass conformance tests. This is not intended to include the actual CLI or HTTP(s) interactions themselves. Only the game rules.

This is expected to include implementations for card mining, validation, and gameplay rules.
